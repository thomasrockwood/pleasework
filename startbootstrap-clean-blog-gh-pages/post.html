                <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">
                    <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
                        <p>One year has elapsed since I first moved to Bucharest, Romania and began assisting in the effort to help Ukrainian refugees. The best way to explain my eye-openeing arrival is to share the email I sent to friends and family that week.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Sleep is for the Weak</h2>
                        <p>I have never been as emotionally and physically exhausted in my entire life. This week, I averaged 4 hours of sleep per night. Even though my body has never felt so trashed, I've had the most spiritual and miraculous week of my mission.</p>
                        <p>At this point, I'm basically a full-time airport employee. We started volunteering at a train station, but got a call that the airport had no translators during the early morning shift (busiest time of the day). Our shift starts at 2 a.m. and we are the only Russian speaking volunteers for the next 8 hours. They converted the info booth at the airport into a Ukranian support center. With literally no training and only 3 months of in-Russia language experience, through the power of God, we have purchased tickets, applied for Visas, reserved hotels, translated for police and check-in gate workers, watched children, planned trip itineraries, researched Covid requirements, called embassies for exepmtions, and provided emotional support for Ukranian refugees. </p>
                        <p>Most Ukranians don't want to stay in Romania because of the language difference and closeness to Ukraine. At first I felt like our work, in that case, was not very important. However, I've had countless experiences that were a testimony to why I was called here. I'll share a few of my favorite:</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Weekly Miracles</h2>
                        <p>We got a call from the Qatar check-in counter that they needed a translator for a big Ukranian family. This family consisted of 8 people, 4 generations, and 3 K-9 dogs. The first problem we ran into was that the workers couldn't read the dogs' Visas and vaccination records. So here I am, translating medical forms in Ukranian (which I don't even speak). Then, we found out that the 9 year-old girl needed a covid test, but they never got one for her. The next step was to call the embassy and simply pray that they would let the family travel without the covid test. For 2 hours we waited for an answer and there were a lot of tears. With only 30 minutes until takeoff, we miraculously got the okay for them to fly. </p>
                        <p>Multiple Ukranian families have said: "I know God placed you here specifically to help me." Two 19-year old brothers told me this after I spent 2 hours planning an obscure way for them to get to Prague. Because they didn't have all of the documents they needed, I helped them book trains, planes, and busses that would eventually help them reunite with their family. I got a text yesterday that they made it safely. </p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">Refugee family whose train tickets were purchased with generous donations from friends and family</span>
                        <p>When I was volunteering at the train station, I would spend a lot of time in the mother's room playing with the kids and listening to the mothers' war experiences. Most all refugees had to leave their husband's behind. That trauma, plus the trauma of feeling the ground shake every 3 minutes and seeing missles destroy buildings 100 feet away, is painful to imagine. Most of the kids had no idea what was going on. Seeing the joy that simply playing with toys brought to the kids gave me reason to never complain about my life situation again. I also met a 15 year-old girl who is going to Germany, all by herself, with nothing but her phone. Her mom was not willing to leave her husband behind.</p>
                        <p>There have been many other life-changing experiences like these, but this email is already wayyyy too long. Just know that I've never been so sure of God's plan. I know that God has helped me be diligent in language study to prepare me for this. I know that I've been on so many planes in the last 6 months just so I could help these Ukrainians who have never flown before.
